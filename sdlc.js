// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

let analysisOfRequirements = " Defining requirements is considered part of planning to determine what its supposed to do"  

let design = " models the way a software application will work "

let implementaion = " Implementation/Coding starts once the developer gets the Design document. The Software design is translated into source code. All the components of the software are implemented in this phase"

let testingAndIntegration = "Its critical to test an application before making it available to users"

let maintain = "Maintenance phase is still important, though. In this phase, users discover bugs that werent found during testing. These errors need to be resolved, which can spawn new development cycles"
